Database management
===================

The database is managed through [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) with
the help of the [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) database
migration framework and [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
as a wrapper for Alembic.

* Create the migration repository:

  `$ flask db init`

* Create a new automatic migration:

  `$ flask db migrate -m "<commit message>"`

* Apply the changes to the database:

  `$ flask db upgrade`
